# Factorio mod: mojo-advanced-tedch
This mod depends on mojo-resource-processing. It makes use of the added ores and metal products. It changed a lot of recipes to use the new materials, but tries to stay true to the real vanilla experience.

## Dependecies
* Factorio >= 0.12.33
* mojo-resource-processing >= 0.3.0

# Current state
Mostly recipe changed and new electronic components as basis for circuit boards.

# Plan
* Add new devices and machines.
